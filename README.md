# earthdata-gis

[NASAâ€™s Earthdata Geographic Information System (EGIS)](gis.earthdata.nasa.gov) is a centralized resource for distributing cloud-native, GIS-ready NASA Earth observation data, services, and resources. This includes ArcGIS and Open Geospatial Consortium 
(OGC)-compliant raster and feature geospatial services and raster analytic functions. EGIS will provide a consistent user 
experience and enhance resource discovery through primary platforms commonly used by the GIS community.

Various data services, maps, apps, and tools will be available through EGIS, including ArcGIS Image Services, which provide a flexible and scalable way to store, process, analyze, and share imagery and raster products. These services leverage a powerful server backend to perform required processing on-the-fly along with dynamic mosaicking of images. Additionally, users can access and perform analysis through open-source tools, such as QGIS and Jupyter Notebooks (some of which are documented here), using the published REST, OGC Web Map Service (WMS), or Web Coverage Service (WCS) endpoints. More information can be found at [Earthdata GIS Learn page](earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/gis).

This repository will serve as an educational space for users looking for examples of using EGIS services in Python, including common processing methods and geospatial platforms. Links to past webinars that use the content found here can be found on the [Earthdata Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO2yB4LGNlWowMYh8wJWDu3oMGbN1GGNN&si=iwfL89PiwOhoBkK2) Updates and additions to the materials contained herein will be performed based on community engagement and feedback as well as common workflows and use cases as identified by EGIS. Coded materials from events such as webinars or conference will also be included here.
