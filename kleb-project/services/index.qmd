NASA’s Earthdata Geographic Information System (EGIS) is a set of cloud-native geospatial data services that make NASA Earth science data easier to discover, access, visualize, and analyze in common Geographic Information System (GIS) environments. These services provide GIS-ready imagery and raster/feature data that comply with standards like ArcGIS and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), so users can integrate NASA satellite and Earth observation data directly into tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and other GIS software.
