    "### Overview \n",
    "Selected [NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Estimated Global Mangroves in the 2000s](https://nasa.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7a4b74ebb65c453482c15554db02cedf) layer data have been processed into a free, publicly available ArcGIS image service that provides analysis-ready, 30-meter resolution estimates of global mangrove distribution, aboveground biomass, and canopy height for the 2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connect to the NASA CMS Global Mangrove ArcGIS ImageService\n",
    "* Inspect service metadata to understand available variables and structure\n",
    "* Define an Area of Interest (AOI) using a geographic bounding box (envelope)\n",
    "* Retrieve a subset of representative mangrove pixel samples (`agb`, `hba`, `hmax`) within the AOI\n",
    "* Clean and filter sampled values to identify pixels containing valid mangrove data\n",
    "* Calculate summary statistics for mangrove variables within the AOI\n",
    "* Visualize the distribution of a selected mangrove variable using a histogram\n",
    "* Display the mangrove imagery, AOI, and sampled pixel locations in an interactive map\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why ArcGIS image services?**  \n",
    "The CMS Global Mangrove Layer is published as an ArcGIS image service, hosted at a service URL with several built-in functions exposed through the [ArcGIS Image Service REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/image-service/). These capabilities (e.g., pixel queries, raster functions, image subsetting, and statistics) can be accessed via web interfaces or called programmatically, providing flexible ways to access, analyze, and display global mangrove data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: ESRI software/licenses are **not** required to access the image service via the REST interfaces or programmatically. No desktop GIS software is required to use this CMS layer (although there are many ways to bring the service into GIS tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required:**\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge (variables, loops, functions)\n",
    "- Familiarity with mangrove ecosystems and/or NASA CMS mangrove products (distribution, biomass, canopy height)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Libraries:**\n",
    "- [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) – sending HTTP requests to the image service REST API  \n",
    "- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) – numerical operations\n",
    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – tabular data handling and summaries\n",
    "- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) – plotting and visualization\n",
    "- [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) – interactive mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data & Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMS Global Mangrove Layer has an ArcGIS portal item page with detailed descriptions of the dataset, including the variables, methods, spatial resolution, and access to the online map viewer. It is strongly recommended to read the full service description to understand the underlying data products and modeling approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mangrove layer is available as an Esri [Living Atlas of the World](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/browse/?q=mangrove#q=mangrove&d=2) imagery layer contributed by NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System and surfaced through the NASA ArcGIS Online organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product**: NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Estimated Global Mangroves in the 2000s  \n",
    "  - Global, 30-meter resolution estimates of mangrove **distribution**, **aboveground biomass**, and **canopy height**, representing conditions in the 2000s.\n",
    "  - **Variables**:\n",
    "    - **agb (Mg ha-1)**: mangrove aboveground biomass measured in *megagrams per hectare*\n",
    "    - **hmax (meters)**: maximum canopy maximum height (height of the tallest tree) measured in *meters*\n",
    "    - **hba (meters)**: basal-area weighted height (individual tree heights weighted in proportion to their basal area).\n",
    "- **Resolution**: 30 m  \n",
    "- **Coverage**: Global mangrove-bearing coastlines  \n",
    "- **Example region**: Everglades National Park area, Florida, USA\n",
    "\n",
    "*Methods demonstrated in this notebook apply to other mangrove regions worldwide and can be adapted to different variables within the CMS Global Mangrove Layer.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a **one-time global snapshot** rather than a time series, the primary “dimension” in this service is the variable (distribution, biomass, canopy height), not time. Temporal analyses (e.g., change over time) can be performed by combining this baseline with other datasets or time-varying products.\n",
    "\n",

    "Although CMS Global Mangrove ImageService stores pixel values as **32-bit floating point numbers (Pixel Type: F32)**, values returned by the ImageServer **getSamples** operation are transmitted through the REST API as **JSON text**. As a result, mangrove variables (`agb`, `hba`, `hmax`) may appear as **strings** when first loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Additionally, `getSamples` distributes sample points across the entire Area of Interest (AOI), including locations where mangroves are not present. For these non-mangrove pixels, the mangrove variables are returned as **empty values**.\n",

    "In this context, **“invalid” entries** refer to:\n",

    "- `map_mangroves()` creates the interactive map and adds:\n",

    "  - The AOI bounding box\n",
    "  - Sampled pixel locations\n",

    "We also attach simple coordinate tools to the map using `coordinate_tool()`. These tools make it easy to identify coordinates of interest and reuse them to define a new AOI."
